# Getting Started with the Onethinx OTX-18

You can get started easily by evaluating on of the [example projects found here.](https://github.com/onethinx/Onethinx_Project_Examples)

[The HelloWorld project](https://github.com/onethinx/Onethinx_Project_Examples/tree/master/Example_HelloWorld) is ideal to start with. You'll need to have a LoRaWAN connected Gateway for receiving the 'Hello World' message.<br><br>If you prefer to evaluate LoRa to LoRa communication or don't have a gateway set up, the [LoRa to LoRa project](https://github.com/onethinx/Onethinx_Project_Examples/tree/master/Example_LoRa) is a good starting point. For this project, two OTX-18 modules/devkits are required.
